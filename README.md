# VR Imaginarium Hardware Repository

## Problem Statement

Virtual reality (VR) holds immense potential to revolutionize education, storytelling, training, and creativity. However, creating immersive VR experiences—especially those that include **haptic feedback**—remains expensive and technically inaccessible for most independent developers, educators, students, and hobbyists. Proprietary haptic hardware is often costly, closed-source, and difficult to modify or extend, creating a barrier for those who want to innovate or explore the full potential of VR.

This lack of affordable, open-source tools limits creativity and experimentation, especially in underserved or low-resource communities where equitable access to cutting-edge technology is critical.

## Solution

**VR Imaginarium** is an open-source hardware toolkit designed to make **affordable and accessible VR development**—including **haptic interactions**—a reality for everyone.

By providing:

- Modular, low-cost hardware components for building custom interfaces
- Open-source firmware and software for easy integration with Unity Game Engine
- Plug-and-play compatibility for education, prototyping, and creative projects

VR Imaginarium empowers creators of all backgrounds to design, build, and share their own immersive experiences. Whether you're an educator designing interactive lessons, a student exploring tactile simulations, or a maker prototyping new VR input devices, VR Imaginarium opens the door to a more inclusive and creative future in virtual reality.
